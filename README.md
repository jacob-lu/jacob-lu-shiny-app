* You should also create a Readme.md file that contains a brief "user
  documentation" of your project: a brief description of the data, and
  explanation what are the widgets and panels doing.  This
  file should contain a link to your project.

*Brief description of the data*: I am using the dataset about the 77 different cereals and
comparing their rating to certain nutritional values. I compare rating to two different variables,
calories and sodium. Through this analysis, I found that there was a negative correlation
between ratings and calories. As ratings increased, calories generally decreased. For
comparisons between ratings and sodium, I did not find any correlation.

*Explanation of widgets and panels*: I used a sidebar panel and a main panel in a fluidpage ui.
This is because the assignment spec expects a side panel and a main panel. I used four widgets
that directly changed the data being displayed. One of the widgets is an action button that
asks the user to update the graph every time he or she changes the input of the three slide bars.
I implemented this method because I think it provides more feedback to the user about when the
graph should be changing. I had three slide bars, that allowed the user to change value of the
ratings, calories, and sodium. I then created two scatter plots, one of them being ratings vs calories
and the other ratings vs sodium. This allowed the user to see if there was any correlation
between ratings and sodium, calories.
